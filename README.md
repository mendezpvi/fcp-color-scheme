# Color Scheme - Solo Project

## *Overview* 🌟

This project is part of the "Working with APIs" module from [**Scrimba**](https://v2.scrimba.com/home)'s [**Frontend Career Path**](https://v2.scrimba.com/the-frontend-developer-career-path-c0j) course. The generator allows users to select a base color and a color scheme to display a color palette based on their selection, using data from The Color API.
